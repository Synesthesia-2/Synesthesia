#Synesthesia v2.0

Synesthesia 2.0 is an interactive, realtime data visualization suite developed at Kinetech in San Francisco.
The application collects, processes, and abstracts audio, orientation, movement, and location data from remote computers and mobile devices and dynamically renders live in-browser displays which can be projected onto a wall, floor, or stage. 
Additionally, a user-friendly control panel page allows for a conductor to enable or disable data transfer from input sources to visualizers and to adjust visualization parameters during a performance while the app is running. 

The modular, plugin-style architechture of v2.0 enables developers and artists to easily integrate new visualizers or data input nodes into the existing framework. 

##Instructions:

Requirements: Node.js, npm (Node.js package manager)

To run on your own network:
  - `git clone https://github.com/strixcuriosus/Synesthesia`
  - Install node, if necessary, and install dependencies via `npm install` and `bower install`
  - `node app.js`

Once you are running the server, navigate to `localhost:8080/conductor` in a touch-enabled device. Audience members should connect their smartphones to the `/` endpoint. On the laptop that is running the visualization, connect to `/fireworks` and a projector. In a separate tab, navigate to `/audio` and allow microphone input through the dialog. The movement performer should carry or wear a phone connected to `/dancer`.

The conductor endpoint can now control the show. After enabling audio input, the internal or external microphone will calibrate for 5-6 seconds to implement noise cancelling filters and input thresholding, and then begin emitting data for the fireworks visualization to render. Manual light show mode will fade through different screen colors on each audience member's phone, allowing the space to be lit according to the pitch of the vocals or to a manually chosen single color. When motion is enabled, the gyroscope data from the `/dancer` endpoint is streamed to the visualization, allowing the firework to move with the performer in space.

## 1.0
This project is based on Synesthesia (v.1.0), an original work by Weidong Yang, George Bonner, David Ryan Hall, Kate Jenkins, and Joey Yang, which was first performed in public on November 17, 2013, at The Garage in San Francisco.
