#Synesthesia

Synesthesia is a sound and movement visualizer developed at Kinetech in San Francisco. It was first performed in public on November 17, 2013, at The Garage in San Francisco.

Synesthesia mixes motion input from mobile devices and audio input to create realtime display in a web browser that can be projected on stage. A tablet device or laptop computer acts in real time to control which client devices drive the light or motion.


##Instructions:

Requirements: Node.js, npm (Node.js package manager)

To run on your own network:
  - `git clone https://github.com/kinetech/Performance`
  - Install node, if necessary, and install dependencies via `npm install`
  - `node app.js`

Once you are running the server, navigate to `localhost:8080/conductor` in a touch-enabled device. Audience members should connect their smartphones to the `/` endpoint. On the laptop that is running the visualization, connect to `/fireworks` and a projector. In a separate tab, navigate to `/audio` and allow microphone input through the dialog. The movement performer should carry or wear a phone connected to `/dancer`.

The conductor endpoint can now control the show. After enabling audio input, the internal or external microphone will calibrate for 5-6 seconds to implement noise cancelling filters and input thresholding, and then begin emitting data for the fireworks visualization to render. Manual light show mode will fade through different screen colors on each audience member's phone, allowing the space to be lit according to the pitch of the vocals or to a manually chosen single color. When motion is enabled, the gyroscope data from the `/dancer` endpoint is streamed to the visualization, allowing the firework to move with the performer in space.
